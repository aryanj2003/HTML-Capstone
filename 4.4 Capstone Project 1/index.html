    <h2>Project experience:</h2>
    <p>
        May 2023- Present (Ecoservity Inc, Chicago)<br>
        Project Inc for  RECYCLING-MADE-EASY for residential usage with a sustainability expert & cloud technology architect:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed object detection for recycling using the Raspberry Pi and Google Vision API.</li>
        <li>Implemented image capturing using the PiCamera module and performed motion detection using frame differencing.</li>
        <li>Utilized the Google & Microsoft  Vision API to detect objects in captured images and obtain labels for further processing.</li>
        <li>Leveraged a PostgreSQL database to retrieve recyclable and non-recyclable objects based on the user's location.</li>
        <li>Implemented a matching algorithm to determine if detected objects are recyclable or not.</li>
        <li>Gained skills in Python programming, Raspberry Pi, image processing, API integration, voice-based interaction, and database operations.</li>
        <li>Trouble shooting in image analysis, data retrieval, and real-time processing,  an interactive voice-based system and presenting project findings.</li>
        <li>Performance tuning by employing database caching techniques, resulting in reduced queries and faster IP address detection.</li>
        <li>Integrated the project with Amazon Alexa Skills Kit to provide voice-based interaction for object detection.</li>
        <li>Integrated a generative AI function using Open AI’s GPT-3.5 model to provide users with additional insights and information on recyclable and non-recyclable objects, enhancing the interactive voice-based system's capabilities for object detection and recycling guidance.</li>
        <li>Incorporated multi-threading functionality to enhance the interactive voice-based system's capabilities for object detection and recycling guidance. This optimization allows the system to seamlessly handle speech input, audio output, and GPT-3.5 AI response generation concurrently, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.</li>
